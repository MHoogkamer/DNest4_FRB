1) Implement your log likelihood in julia_model.jl, as a function
	called log_likelihood that takes a Vector::Float64 as an argument
	and returns a Float64. You should assume that the priors for the
	parameters are independent Uniform(0, 1) distributions. To use
	a different prior, transform the parameters inside
	your log_likelihood function before using them.

2) You may add other functions to julia_model.jl, for example to load
	a dataset to refer to in your log_likelihood.

3) Set an environmental variable JULIA_PATH to the directory on your system
	which contains the Julia shared library files
	(particularly, the files libjulia.so and sys.so).

4) Compile by invoking 'make'. Note: only a single thread can be used.
