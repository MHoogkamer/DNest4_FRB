DNest4
======

DNest4 is a C++11 implementation of Diffusive Nested Sampling.

Improvements over DNest3:

*	There are far fewer dependencies --- all you need is a C++ compiler that
	supports the C++11 standard, along with Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib
	for the post-processing scripts.

*	The licence is now the permissive MIT licence.

*	RJObject is now included in the same repository.

Some functions have slightly different names and specifications compared to
DNest3. These changes are purely cosmetic.
The manual (in the doc directory) can be compiled with pdflatex.
