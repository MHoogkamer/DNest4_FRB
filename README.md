DNest4
======

A rewrite of DNest3 in C++11, with minimal dependencies
and a permissive licence. To compile, just use `make'.
Usage is very similar to DNest3, whose manual you can get
from the DNest3 repository: https://github.com/eggplantbren/DNest3.

Some slight (yet important) differences from DNest3 are the names of the
functions in the model classes. However, you should be able to infer the
relevant changes by inspecting the DNest4 version
of SpikeSlab.h and SpikeSlab.cpp.
